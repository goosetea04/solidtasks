# solidtasks

**solidtasks** is a Flutter-based task management app that leverages decentralized data storage and fine-grained access control using [Solid Pods](https://solidproject.org/). This project empowers users to securely create, store, and share tasks while maintaining full ownership and privacy over their data.

## Features

* **Decentralized Storage:** All user tasks are stored in the user's own Solid Pod, not on a centralized server.
* **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Share tasks with specific individuals or groups using Solid's flexible access control features.
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop via Flutter.
* **Open Source:** Licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
